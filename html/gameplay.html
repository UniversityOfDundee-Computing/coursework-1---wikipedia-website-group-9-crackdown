            <h3 class="text-center">Plot</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Crackdown is a third-person shooter set in a sandbox environment, akin to Mercenaries:
              Playground of Destruction. After selecting one of the predefined Agent characters, the player is assigned
              to defeat the Kingpin of each gang, though there is no precise approach to do this, leaving players to
              select their preferred method. While the player may face the Kingpin and his bodyguards at any time, they
              can improve their chances of taking out the Kingpin by facing and defeating the various Generals
              responsible for certain aspects of the Kingpin's offense and defense, removing them from play. For
              example, by eliminating a gang's weapon dealer, gang members will no longer be as heavily armed or will
              fire fewer shots to conserve ammunition; assassinating the gang recruitment officer similarly reduces the
              size of the Kingpin's protective force. It is at the player's discretion whether to kill the Generals or
              skip them entirely before facing the Kingpin. However, the gangs cannot be completely eradicated from the
              city without tracking down and killing all Generals and Kingpins.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!--second card of info similar to one above-->
      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pt-4">
        <div class="card mb-4">
          <img src="../img/crackdownAbilities.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="crackdown abilities">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h3 class="text-center">Abilities</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Much like other sandbox games, the player uses melee attacks, guns, and explosives to
              fight the opposing forces, and can run, climb buildings, jump across rooftops, or use vehicles to navigate
              the city. Crackdown features a series of character-based skills that can be upgraded to increase specific
              traits that can be used in combat, driving, or on-foot agility. These skills include: "Agility", which
              increases the Agent's ability to jump, run, and swim; "Driving", affecting how well he can handle a
              vehicle and upgrades it; "Explosives", which affects the power and range of explosive weapons and
              explosive power; "Strength" that increases the Agent's strength, namely by increasing his ability to lift
              and throw, as well as how hard he can strike an opponent and increases health; and "Firearms", which
              improves the character's aptitude with weapons. Crackdown's skills make few concessions to realism:
              character abilities are similar to those of comic book superheroes or cartoon characters. This concept is
              further highlighted by the ink-like outlines drawn around in-game characters.</p>

      <!--this card is wider and shorter-->
      <div class="card mb-3">
        <img src="../img/crackdownSkills.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="crackdown image">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title text-center">Skills</h3>
          <p class="card-text">Skills are usually improved by gaining experience orbs, which are released from defeated
            enemies. The type of orb released varies, depending on how the player dispatched the foe; for instance,
            killing an enemy with a gun will earn Firearms orbs, while running them over with a vehicle earns Driving
            orbs. More powerful enemies release more experience orbs. However, Agility orbs are awarded differently:
            they can be earned by either climbing buildings and seeking them on rooftops, or by killing an enemy from a
            high altitude. The player can also compete in "rooftop races", a race through a series of waypoints across
            the rooftops of Pacific City, or car races to gain Agility and Driving orbs, respectively.[4] A few special
            orbs, well-hidden, increase all character abilities when found.[4] A final way to collect orbs is by earning
            achievements, which rewards the player with orbs from every skill category. Each skill has five
            levels—beginning with zero stars, and ending with four—with a numeric gauge on the display to indicate how
            close the player is to the next level. Should the character die, or injure civilians or Agency peacekeepers,
            their experience gain will be slowed, making it temporarily harder to improve the character's traits.</p>

          <h1>The Map</h1>
          <p>The entirety of Pacific City may be explored from the start of the game, allowing the player to locate the
            hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around
            the city. Once a supply point is unlocked, the player has the option of returning there to travel to any
            other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently
            add them to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While
            exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how
            badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the
            non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit
            squads are dispatched to take them down.</p>

          <h1 class="text-end">Co-op</h1>
          <p>Crackdown features an online two-player cooperative play mode that allows drop-in play. Both players may
            explore the city freely, with the other player's position noted on the HUD map. Players can fight alongside
            each other, and also inflict friendly-fire damage. The state of the city, including which Generals and
            Kingpins remain, is determined by the host player's progress. Both players are credited with the defeat of a
            General or Kingpin in the game—which will affect the state of the guest's progress—but are required to
            obtain supply points and gain experience independently. Co-op players can race against each other in both
            rooftop and road races, should they both choose to participate.</p>
